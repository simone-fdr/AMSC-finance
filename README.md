# Black-Scholes

## How to test

Use the command "make" to compile the program

The program uses as input the input.csv file that has been already provided

In case one would create its own input file there is a Python script (both in .py and .ipynb format) that create the input with preferred input values ranges

The source file of the main project is BSMain.cpp and all the other file are inside the project folder.

The NewtonMain.cpp file is not compiled nor used and it is included only to show the use of pointers and complex templated function

There might be some problem with the "newline", the code has been tested only on windows machines.
